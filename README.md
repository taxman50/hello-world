intro program

Hello World!  
This is my first use of Github. I've become interested in learning programming over the past few months and am excited to begin using Github! CS50x brought me here. 

Update to file - so I'm wrapping up the CS50 course, and one of my goals is to begin using Github to maintain my code.  So I'm picking this file back up with a goal of learning how to leverage Github as a repository.
